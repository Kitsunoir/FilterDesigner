      preprocessor to add directly rather than tying up memory by
      using "const char*" type variables.

"  How _you_ can help dolphins:\n"\
"\n"\
"  1) The dolphin slave trade (aka the captivity industry) exists for\n"\
"\tone purpose only: they're in it for the money. Despite what they\n"\
"\tmay have told you over the years, it is not now, nor has it ever\n"\
"\tbeen about scientific research, conservation or education. It has\n"\
"\t_always_ been about the money. Don't patronize any show,\n"\
"\tamusement park, or tourist attraction that features captive\n"\
"\tdolphins. Don't contribute to their bogus \"conservation\" funds,\n"\
"\tor so-called \"research\". Don't watch their TV specials; stay\n"\
"\toff their web sites. Remember: if you don't buy the ticket, the\n"\
"\tshow can't go on.\n"\
"\n"\
"  2) Continue to educate yourself about the issues involved. Visit:\n"\
"\twww.dolphinproject.org, www.dolphinawareness.org,\n"\
"\twww.seashepherd.org, or www.freethedolphins.com. The more one\n"\
"\tlearns about the free dolphin, the more he pities the captive dolphin.\n"\
"\n"\
"  3) Make your position known to friends and family. Friends don't\n"\
"\tlet friends subsidize the dolphin slave trade.\n"\
"\n"\
"  4) Consider making a contribution. Take the price of the ticket to\n"\
"\tthe dolphin show you didn't attend and donate it to one of the\n"\
"\tabove mentioned organizations, or one of your own choosing.\n"\
"\tSince Networks-n-Filters is free software, consider a donation for\n"\
"\twhatever you think it's worth.\n"\
"\n"\
"              IF SOFTWARE CAN BE FREE, WHY CAN'T DOLPHINS?"\
