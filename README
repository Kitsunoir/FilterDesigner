NetworkDesigner is a graphical program for the design of impedance matching
networks. Included are nine of the most widely used topologies. The simplest
ones don't allow for the independent selection of Q-factor. Three reactance
matching networks, however, do allow for this within reason, of course.

Project results may be printed in both graphical form and a text-only
form. The FOX library assumes a Post Script printed, and some of the
Linux compatable printers use something a bit different these days.

See the on-line help for further details on using NetworkDesigner.

Filter Designer was developed with the FOX toolkit (http://www.fox-toolkit.org),
XEMACS (http://www.xemacs.org),
and Data Display Debugger
